# Ramya's First CS193 Homework
## My GitHub Page  _- Ramya Rajaram_

I am using the [editor in GitHub](https://github.com/Purdue-CS193/homework-0-ramyarakr/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever one commits to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Different writing styles  _(my trial and edits)_
**This is bold.**
_This is Italic._
`This is a code.`

### My bulleted list
**_My favorite things about CS 193 are:_**
- The Course Instructors/ TAs 
- The information/knowledge I gain regarding programming tools
- The friends I have made in the class
- The USB and its resources

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
